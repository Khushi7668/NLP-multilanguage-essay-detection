# Abstract Section
doc.add_heading('3. ‚ú® Abstract', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "This project presents a Streamlit-based multilingual essay evaluation system designed to assess essays "
    "written in various Indian languages. The system integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect "
    "the language of the essay, preprocess the text, analyze sentiment, provide constructive feedback, and generate concise summaries."
    " Supporting nine Indian languages, the system leverages tools like IndicNLP, MBart (HuggingFace), and langdetect. "
    "It evaluates essays based on vocabulary diversity, length, sentiment tone, sentence structure, and overall coherence. "
    "This platform is particularly beneficial in educational settings to automate essay assessments while maintaining linguistic inclusivity."

# Introduction Section
doc.add_heading('4. üîç Introduction', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "In a multilingual country like India, educational assessments often involve essays written in various regional languages. "
    "Traditional evaluation methods are time-consuming and may lack consistency. This project aims to address these challenges by "
    "developing an automated essay evaluation system that supports multiple Indian languages."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "By integrating advanced NLP techniques, the system provides educators with a tool to efficiently assess essays, offering "
    "consistent and objective evaluations. This not only saves time but also ensures fairness in the assessment process."
